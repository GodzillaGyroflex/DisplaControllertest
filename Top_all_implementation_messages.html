<tr><td>xst</td><td>WARNING&nbsp;</td><td>Xst:1780 - Signal &lt;reset&gt; is never used or assigned. This unconnected signal will be trimmed during the optimization process.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>xst</td><td>WARNING&nbsp;</td><td>Xst:737 - Found 16-bit latch for signal &lt;value_out&gt;. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>xst</td><td>WARNING&nbsp;</td><td>Xst:647 - Input &lt;Mode&gt; is never used. This port will be preserved and left unconnected if it belongs to a top-level block or it belongs to a sub-block and the hierarchy of this sub-block is preserved.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>xst</td><td>WARNING&nbsp;</td><td>Xst:647 - Input &lt;ring_out&gt; is never used. This port will be preserved and left unconnected if it belongs to a top-level block or it belongs to a sub-block and the hierarchy of this sub-block is preserved.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>xst</td><td>WARNING&nbsp;</td><td>Xst:647 - Input &lt;Stress&gt; is never used. This port will be preserved and left unconnected if it belongs to a top-level block or it belongs to a sub-block and the hierarchy of this sub-block is preserved.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td>xst</td><td>INFO&nbsp;</td><td>Xst:2169 - HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

ring_out_IBUF,
Stress_IBUF

<tr><td>map</td><td>INFO&nbsp;</td><td>MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>map</td><td>INFO&nbsp;</td><td>LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>map</td><td>WARNING&nbsp;</td><td>PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net Counter/rst is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td>par</td><td>INFO&nbsp;</td><td>Par:282 - No user timing constraints were detected or you have set the option to ignore timing constraints ("par -x"). Place and Route will run in "Performance Evaluation Mode" to automatically improve the performance of all internal clocks in this design. Because there are not defined timing requirements, a timing score will not be reported in the PAR report in this mode. The PAR timing summary will list the performance achieved for each clock. Note: For the fastest runtime, set the effort level to "std".  For best performance, set the effort level to "high".</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td>par</td><td>WARNING&nbsp;</td><td>Par:288 - The signal Mode_IBUF has no load.  PAR will not attempt to route this signal.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>par</td><td>WARNING&nbsp;</td><td>Par:288 - The signal ring_out_IBUF has no load.  PAR will not attempt to route this signal.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>par</td><td>WARNING&nbsp;</td><td>Route:455 - CLK Net:Counter/rst may have excessive skew because 
   8 CLK pins and 8 NON_CLK pins failed to route using a CLK template.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>par</td><td>INFO&nbsp;</td><td>Timing:2761 - N/A entries in the Constraints List may indicate that the constraint is not analyzed due to the following: No paths covered by this constraint; Other constraints intersect with this constraint; or This constraint was disabled by a Path Tracing Control. Please run the Timespec Interaction Report (TSI) via command line (trce tsi) or Timing Analyzer GUI.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>par</td><td>WARNING&nbsp;</td><td>ParHelpers:361 - There are 3 loadless signals in this design. This design will cause Bitgen to issue DRC warnings.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td>trce</td><td>INFO&nbsp;</td><td>Timing:3339 - The clock-to-out numbers in this timing report are based on a 50 Ohm transmission line loading model.  For the details of this model, and for more information on accounting for different loading conditions, please see the device datasheet.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

Please make appropriate modification to SYSTEM_JITTER to account for the unsupported Discrete Jitter and Phase Error.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></table>
